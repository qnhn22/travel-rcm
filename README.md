## Technologies Used

Travex is built using React and NodeJS with Google Maps API and Travel Advisor API. The user interface is designed using Material-UI and TailwindCSS, and data is fetched using Axios.



## Future Improvements

In the future, the developers plan to implement an authorization system and a notification system. The authorization system will allow users to sign up and sign in to the app, while the notification system will enable users to fill in a form with information about their upcoming trip. The app will then send recommended restaurants, attractions, and hotels based on the user's preferences.
